The push for digitization and automation of reports is becoming the standard and employers are now looking for candidates with exposure to business intelligence and statistical packages such as Python and Microsoft Power BI. As such, to improve my analytical skills via machine learning, I recently pursued a post graduate certificate in Data Analytics at Durham College.

This page will demonstrate my experience with data tools such as Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, MySQL, Python and more.

# Experience With Microsoft Power BI

I have utilized Microsoft Power BI to:
1. Transform data: eliminate unecessary data/ merge data sheets
2. Analyze data 
3. Draw insights to facilitate data based decision making
4. Create interactive visualizations and dashboards
5. Create reports and presentations

Below is a video presentation created after generating insights using Power BI.  The subject centers around the Covid-19 pandemic and utilized data (as of April 2022) to determine if relaxing existing measures were appropriate. The assumption: "You have been hired as an advisor to the Prime Minister of Canada. Your task is to analyze the current COVID-19 situation, evaluate effectiveness of existing measures and recommend when Canada should call the end of pandemic."

# Experience With Tableau

I have used Tableau to assess a number of datasets, create visualizations and assess performance by geographical location.  Below I will highlight a few projects which I have undertaken.

### Utlizing Data to Tell a Story
The raw dataset was provided. The ask: clean and arrange dataset, review and analyze data to derive a possible Challenge, Challenge Demonstration, Solution Introduction, Solution Description, Impact of Solution and Recommendation. In doing so, it is required to create your own logo and anything else needed to support the story.

**Vaccination Rates Globally**

Only raw dataset was provided.  The ask: use provided data to create a data narrative. Create personal brand and story and offer possible recommendation to a derived problem.

### Dashboard Creation

Used dataset on job postings in Canada to create a dashboard based on insights generated.  The dataset was very large, as such, the dashboard highlighted the following:
1. The most popular job title
2. Province with the most job listings
3. Map depiction of hiring companies
4. Popular job titles in province generated from point 2
5. Jobs by province for title generated from point 1

**Insights**
1. Most popular job title was 'Data Analyst'
2. Province with the most job postings was Ontario
3. There were more hiring companies in Ontario - 1,321


**Takeaway**

Popular jobs are data centered, hence clients were encouraged to upskill in this area.
